# Dependency Management

Use this skill when work touches `pubspec.yaml`, `pubspec.lock`, or package
version choices.

## Rules

- Prefer Flutter or Dart built-ins first.
- Add a runtime dependency only when the package clearly needs it.
- Remember that `dependencies:` become transitive dependencies for package
  consumers.
- Keep unrelated version bumps out of the same diff.

## Hygiene

- Touch `pubspec.lock` only when the work requires it.
- Keep `README.md` and tests aligned when a dependency changes package
  behavior.

## Read These

- `.claude/policies/dependency-policy.md`
- `.claude/policies/publishing.md`
- `.claude/policies/public-repo.md`
